There are so many reasons why a mother would give up breastfeeding and I wish the healthcare provider would know that rather than pushing the duty of exclusive breastfeeding on the mother and guilt them when they don't. 

## Lack of Milk

The first week of baby L's life was tough. My colostrum did not come in post-delivery. I would spend 1 hour getting her to develop interest in the breasts and this was a recurring event that would happen every 3-4 hours. Unlike other mammals, babies do not know how to latch immediately post-birth. 

When your baby cries because you don't have enough milk, you feel terrible as a mother. Baby L was hospitalized on day 3 because she was turning yellow (jaundice). I started pumping while baby L was hospitalized for her jaundice to make sure that the breasts are stimulated to produce milk. I would pump for 20 minutes and have &lt;5 ml of milk produced from both breasts. The pumping sessions were every 3 hours. I woke up at night to pump even though I knew that no milk was coming out. Over the span of 1 day = 7 pumping sessions... I managed to produce 30ml... which was just enough for 1 meal. Obviously it was not enough for baby L so she had to have formula during her hospitalization. 

I tried every hack... mother's tea and blue Gatorade. None of them worked for me. I was working myself up for not producing enough milk. The amount of stress and lack of sleep was impacting the milk supply. 

A knocked some sense to me when he took the baby away and told me that I needed to rest. Finally, after much coaxing, I said ðŸ¤¬it and I slept for 5 hours straight. Then the milk finally came. Still, I was underproducing for the first month of baby L's life. Constantly worried that she won't have enough milk for the next day. 

## Mastitis

I had mastitis once my milk started to come in week 2. Mastitis is an inflamed breast from a blocked milk duct. You get symptoms like the worst flu in your life and it potentially drops your milk supply. The last time that I was this sick was in college when I had a 39 degree fever and still insisted on going to my psychology class. I vividly recall me sitting in front of the chapel in the middle of the quad on the grass... contemplating on the weight of my backpack and whether or not to leave it in the middle of the quad so I can drag myself back to my dorm. I was weak and had chills. On the other hand, I never missed a single day in class in college. 

Yeah, I was wearing a sweater while I had chills and the bedsheet was soaked with sweats. This was my gynaecologist's reaction when he heard that I had mastitis 2 times ðŸ˜±and self-treated.  The boobs were very painful when this happens. Mastitis was not very fun and I got it 3 times post-pregnancy. To unblock the duct, you had to massage it out. Even though the pain was not as bad as childbirth, I dreaded unblocking the duct every day because it was a daily recurrence of pain. 

## Strawberry Milk

I did a mixture of pumping and breastfeeding. Baby L was still learning to latch and she was very rough. I would end up with bleeding nipples. I pumped strawberry milk the first day that I went back to work (2 months post-delivery). No amount of padding eased the pain that you could feel every time the nipple hits the bra. The skin was raw ðŸ˜­.

## Q4Hourly Pump

My biggest enemy for sleep was pumping. The easy way out was to formula-feed my baby so I could stop pumping since I was back at work and desperately needed to sleep in order to be functional during the day. It requires a huge amount of conscious discipline to wake up and pump at 4 AM for the first 3 months of baby L's life. I could only sleep 3 hours at a time and get about 6 hours of sleep every night. 

## The Road to Weaning

My plan was to continue to torture myself for 6 months as per WHO's recommendation. But miracles do happen. It has been 4 months and I have stopped breastfeeding baby L. It was baby-led weaning. She decided she did not want breasts anymore. She wanted to hold her own bottles when she feeds. I am still pumping but I push back my nighttime pump to 5 AM. I guess you could say that things are going swimmingly, but we will see...
