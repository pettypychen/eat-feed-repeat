üáπüá≠ **Phuket, Thailand**

Facing the Andaman Sea, Trisara is a beautiful beachfront resort. If you like nature, Trisara is the right place to go. On the way up to our villa, we were surrounded by tropical forest (this is because the roads to Trisara are part of the Sirinat National Park). This is not the place to go if you plan to do a lot of activities on the Phuket island. This is our second time in Phuket so we just wanted to sit back and relax/get our Thai massages at the villa.

**Nature = Mosquitos**: BEWARE OF MOSQUITOS, Trisara has thoughtfully prepared citronella bug sprays in the room for the guests to use. I literally had to rub in a lot of sprays. Always, always close the door behind you. You do not want to come back at night as mosquito snack. I swear the mosquitos only suck foreigner's bloods. The locals don't seem to be bothered by them at all.

Welcome gift included a bottle of champagne and chocolate nougat. A ate it all everyday. Exotic fresh fruits were also included (rambutan). Breakfast are served daily. We recommend Pad Thai, Thai style eggs, and fried rice. There was turndown service every night. To get a golf cart to main lobby simply call the main line and they will send down a driver. Massage are on the pricy side. If you can afford the price, we think it would be a good experience to try. If you want a simple Thai massage, we recommend to try your luck in old Phuket town. We indulged on a private honeymoon dinner by poolside. The chef came to set up the table by the infinity pool and grilled our steak and lobsters. Truly fantastic experience. I would love to return to Trisara someday.
