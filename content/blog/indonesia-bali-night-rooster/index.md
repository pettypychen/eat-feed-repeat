Locavoreâ€™s new bar Night Rooster is located between the restaurant and the deli and offers charming views of Jalan Dewi Sita from its second floor location. The airy yet intimate ambience is enhanced with recycled wood, including a magnificent recycled ironwood floor in the friendly 40 seat bar. Here alchemist Raka creates exciting cocktails from premium spirits imaginatively combined with local fruits, herbs, vegetables and spices. Raka makes his own bitters and experiments with exotic infusions.

A and I found this place in the heavy rain/walking down Jalan Dewi Sita towards Ubud Palace. Totally spontaneous! Because of the heavy rain, we skipped the romantic dinner at the riverside and went to explore Ubud instead. After getting lost, we passed by Locavore's main branch, but then we realized that it was omakase-styled with either 5 dishes or 7 dishes options. We weren't that hungry and wanted something with smaller portions. The server at Locavore pointed out that the Night Rooster serves some of the dishes that they are serving at the main branch a la carte. The lady was like the Night Rooster is on the second floor of the Monkey's restaurant. We were like huh, because we didn't even notice it on our way there. After taking a closer look, we found the Night Rooster's entrance on the side (in the alleyway). We had the bar all to ourselves. I guess no one drinks at 7PM.

Locavore uses recycled woods for most of their decorations/furniture. They are big on the farm to table concepts. All of their ingredients are locally farmed (more on this later in the Locavore To Go post). The food was really delicious. I totally regretted not doing the omakase. We tried to see if we could book a table at the main branch for the next day. Unfortunately, the night that we visited was the only night it was free in the month of November!!! I was super sad, but A found Locavore To Go and we decided that we shall go there the next day before we leave Ubud.   
  
I took the pictures with my iPhone. It was just too dark to get proper picture without flash. A had to use his iPhone to light up the food for me to take these pictures.   
  
The food was so good that you have to try it yourself.
