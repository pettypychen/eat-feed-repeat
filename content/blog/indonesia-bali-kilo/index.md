Distinguished by unconventional and modern minimalist architecture that challenges the traditional landscape, Kilo Bali offers a quiet respite away from all the hustle and bustle."_  
  
Although the original Kilo is in Singapore, we have never tried it. This was a last minute pick for food that isn't too heavy on the palate before we fly off. We booked a table for 7PM on the same day.  
  
â€‹Funny story about eating here: A and I thought a 20 min walk in Seminyak is like nothing so we set up our offline google map and headed for the restaurant. I realized that we probably would have been better off just hailing a Blue Bird Taxi off the road. The streets in Bali are narrow with lots of holes and cars driving onto the sidewalk to get past the traffic. You have to be careful not to get hit by the Caucasian tourists on scooters who don't really watch where they are going. Surprisingly, I have rarely seen any Chinese tourists on scooters. The ones that I encountered were all pretty well behaved. During our Bali trip, there was this girl who just U-turned on the street without even looking behind her. Thank goodness the locals quickly got out of her way. This is definitely bad tourist etiquette. If you are going to make a random U-turn on the streets in your home country, then you should not do it in Asia. Ignorance is not bliss, it is definitely dangerous here.

Minimalist furniture! The walls are concrete so they chose wooden chairs and glass tables to give it a warmer feel.   
  
â€‹The menu comes with small plates and one for all plates. These are the smaller plates.

Wasabi Tuna Tartare- avocado, tuna, and sesame seeds. Nom nom nom. I love Bali's tartare.

Crispy Soft Shell Crab- compressed watermelon with Thai red curry gravy.

Squid Ink Rice- crispy baby squid, salmon roe, and garlic aioli. You must try this dish. The dish is salty and feels like you are eating the ocean, but in a good way.

Cream of Ebiko Pasta- smelted roe and grilled tiger prawns. The pasta was one long continuous yummy ribbon. Fresh tiger prawns were just right, not overly chewy.

O J Simpson- I chuckled over this drink name. It was pretty delicious.
