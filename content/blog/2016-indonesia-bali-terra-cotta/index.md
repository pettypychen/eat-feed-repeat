A here again, I'm guest blogging while P is editing photos from one of our recent trips. For a change of pace, we moved from Seminyak to Ubud and started off our journey at the Terracotta Restaurant, which allows diners to eat amongst the rice paddies in the quiet sanctuary of the Mathis Retreat Ubud. Especially after spending the past few days in the busier, cosmopolitan part of Bali, it was refreshing to have a quiet lunch in the rice paddies.

Risotto balls on vegetable tempura, bell paper coulis, rosemary, garlic tuille, and cream cheese sauce; mix chicken, beef, and tuna sate with peanut sauce and fresh vegetables; terracotta ravioli with signature terracotta sauce.

Pan-seared sesame seed mahi mahi and steamed snapper stuffed with seasonal fruits served with sauteed Asian vegetables and rice. 

With an emphasis on classic tastes and light flavors, Terracotta offered a wide variety of dishes including both traditional Indonesian fare as well as international cuisine. We opted to have a bit of both, including fish two ways, refreshingly light risotto balls and ravioli, and mixed sates. Especially for the very reasonable prices we paid, the food on the whole was very fresh and well worth the value. I'd highly recommend Terracotta for those who want to escape from the hustle and bustle of the touristy side of Bali for a quiet meal with loved ones.
