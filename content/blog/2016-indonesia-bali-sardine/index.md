This was our first meal in Bali. Sardine is known as one of the best restaurants in Bali for its fresh seafood. You can look out to the field of rice paddies while you dine. The perk of off season = we shared the entire restaurant with another couple. A and I sat there chilling for a few hours. BTW, the yellow fin tuna tartare was divine.

* Marinated pork chops. Meat isn't Sardine's specialty. I would suggest that you try more seafood. Although this dish was delicious, it was not worth the price tag.

* Asparagus scallop risotto. It was very fresh and the scallop texture was just right. Not too chewy or too tough.

Find your sense of inner peace at the side garden. Lilies were blooming. The restaurant was completely open so bring mosquito spray to avoid bites.
