Bincho is slightly more on the pricier side (given it is located in our favourite hipster district). But if you do go, remember to try out Charcoal Grilled Mentaiko Chicken Wings (left) and Grilled Beef Tongue (right). TBH, I was very meh about the beef tongue when A recommended it. I was subsequently wow off my socks for this dish. It was literally mouth-watering good. The chicken wings on the other hand are their signature items. If you are a carnivore, you would love the texture of a charcoal grilled chicken.

The dish in the middle is salmon and tuna sashimi. I won't say too much about it as it is a standard item in most Japanese restaurant.

Hamburger steak with raw egg (above). This was one of A's favourite items from our sampling dishes, for two simple reasons: 1) meat and 2) really well cooked meat.

Oyako Don (above). More grilled chicken!

Crispy pork with truffles (above). I love truffles so I could not say no to this dish. The pork was crispy but slightly over-seasoned. The truffles were in its purest form so I pretty much just ate the whole thing (nom).

Mochi ice-cream with fresh strawberries (above) = a good ending to our dinner.

â€‹The reason why I was not really a fan was mainly the small portions. Don't get me wrong. The food was definitely great, I just not willing to pay the price to eat lots and lots grilled meat. It is best that you come with an empty stomach/ eat lots and lots of veggies post Bincho meat feast. If you are on paleo, this is the place for you.   
  
**Afternote**: We went back to Bincho recently to try out their lunch menu. It was definitely worth the price. However, if you are not used to raw eggs don't temper with fate.
