Closer to the San Marco area, Arlas Le Delizie Greche is a nice hip Greek restaurant. If you like Greek food, you should check this place out. Their pita breads are freshly made. Everything is FRESH!

We order the lunch menu. The pita bread was warm/nicely heated up for us. The fries are also pretty amazing. If I recall correctly the set we got was roughly around â‚¬10, which is pretty rare for a meal in Florence. The portion is big which is good if you have a male travel companion. I could not finish my plate!
