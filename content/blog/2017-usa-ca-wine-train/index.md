It was a beautiful weekend in Napa and I guess June is the right time to go if you want to see lots of greenery everywhere in Napa. Thank goodness the drought was over.  
  
**Attire**: Napa casual (sun dress + sandals or khaki with a polo top) is the perfect way to go. It was surprisingly informal compared to some of the wineries that we have been to in Italy.  
  
We opted for a train to ferry us around Napa valley. Driving is an alternative option but try to avoid the busy hours like lunch/dinner time to drive around the downtown area (you will have to park super far away). We both wanted to do the wine tasting, so I guess the train was a good choice.  
  
The train was supposed to be a classy affair, but we had some companions who were already drunk by the time that we started the train, so that was not too pleasant. I guess if you want a better experience, perhaps avoid the weekend. If you want a more intimate experience at a particular winery, I would suggest that you just pick one and spend maybe half of the day there. You can sober up on a nice picnic blanket and then drive to the next winery.  
  
I am a lightweight, so the Napa train was too much wine for me and too fast. I pretty much napped most of the train ride after some awesome reds + small bites on the train.

We started from Napa and then traveled up to St. Helena.ItineraryRobert MondaviCharles KrugV. SattuiYou are probably wondering, if the wine train is called Quattro Vino (4 wineries), why we ended up with 3 wineries? I think in 2016, they started the tour with 4 wineries, but it was too rushed so they decided to reduce it to 3 wineries. Remember, they gotta babysit some drunk people on the train and these drunk people don't always come back to the train on time. If you are a wine connoisseur, you might find the schedule too packed for your liking.

## Robert Mondavi

**Disclaimer #1**: I do not know very much of Napa wine history, but this was what our guide told us.  
  
Did you know that Robert Mondavi was a Stanford grad who started his business with one of the most innovative chemical engineering techniques for his time? Like all great Californians, the Mondavi(s) were immigrants. Our guide told us that Napa used to have crappy grapes and that these immigrants brought the superior grape species in from Europe and planted them in Napa. The Mondavi family started with selling grapes to everyone around the Napa region to produce wine. Given his background in chemical engineering, Robert became interested in making his own wine and started experimenting on his own. Like all faithful sons, Robert tried to stay in the family business. However, due to an unfortunate feud with his brother, Robert decided to leave and start his own winery, which became the Robert Mondavi Winery. BUT, he sold this in 2000+ to a multinational Belgium company, reconciled with his brother, and died peacefully in Napa on the Mondavi estate in St. Helena. Some people might say his wine is too commercialized.  
  
**What we bought:** Moscato. A thought the sauvignon blanc was too dry.  
  
**Disclaimer #2:** I am not a true wine lover (because I love Moscato too much to care about anything else).

## Charles Krug

Ah, Charles Krug, it is owned by the Mondavi(s) too. Charles Krug was an immigrant from Prussia. He was one of the first ones to buy up large plots of land in St. Helena (now worth millions). I guess Charles Krug was just an unfortunate soul. His cellar was built from wood so it burnt down and subsequently he ran into financial trouble. He had to sell his winery. The Mondavi family bought it, expanded it, and built their homes on the land. The estate is currently owned by Peter Mondavi and the third generations of kids who are still making wine under the label of Charles Krug. This is one of the few remaining wineries in Napa that is family owned. The estate is gorgeous. A perfect wedding venue if you can afford the price tag.  
  
**What we bought**: nothing, I was too drunk at this point to make a decision of purchase.

## V. Sattui

Guess who else has been secretly buying up land in Napa to make wine? It is Yao Ming, the NBA basketball player. http://www.yaofamilywines.com/  My train conductor must think all Asians are related or something.Train conductor: Y'all know that Yao's got a winery up here in Napa?Me: Who is Yao?Train conductor: Yao Ming, your fellow countryman and I am cooking for his BBQ next weekend. I heard he has invited a few of his NBA friends.Me: Thanks for letting me know, cool beans. | This was not my train conductor by the way. â€‹â€‹I guess I should have asked for an invitation to Yao Ming's BBQ. |

This is a family friendly winery. You will see lots of couples hanging out with toddlers with wine glasses in hand. I don't advocate for this kind of parenting, but I guess parents probably need a lot of "chill" time. They have multiple vineyards around California and some of these vineyards do sustainable farming and are organic. The guide did not give very much juicy details about the winery's past (I guess there was no family drama).  
  
I love their wine. I would come back here to chill on a big picnic blanket. I can see myself spending the whole day here.  
  
**What we bought**: 2015 Sauvignon Blanc and 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon  
V. Sattui sells their wines exclusively on site, so if you come you better stock up if you like their wine.

**Would I come back to Napa?** Yes  
**Would I do the wine train again?** Probably no, unless I can buy a ticket for a cheaper price from Costco.
