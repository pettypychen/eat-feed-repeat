Malis was a 5 min walk (10 min in the rain with no lights on the road) from our villa. It is one of the highly recommended places to eat at in Siem Reap. Colonial style building. It is split into a bar area and dining area with a courtyard at the center.


Malis has fresh seafood ingredients cooked in Khmer style.   
  
* Kampot Crab Fried Rice- Kaffir-flavored rice cooked in fresh crab juice, wok fried to bring out its colour, with Kampot crab meat.  
* Scallops with Green Peppercorns: Fresh pan-fried Sihanoukville scallops flavour-enhanced with Kampot green peppercorns picked straight from the vine and freshly crushed garlic.  
* Roasted Semi-Wild Chicken- Roasted local free-range chicken marinated with palm sugar, chilii, garlic and homemade seasoning oil. Served with a choice of sauces.

We drank lots of alcohol or warm water because we did not think that our stomach can tolerate the water in Cambodia. Just be very careful when you eat out. Usually their higher-end restaurants tend to serve warm water or bottled water. However, I did read that some vendors will recycle the bottles and fill it with Cambodian tap water. Make sure that the seals are intact and that the water level is not filled to the top.
