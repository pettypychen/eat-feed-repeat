We did not exchange any Cambodian Riel. In Cambodia, people generally accept USD so we just carried lots of dollar bills with us to pay for everything. They will give you small change in Cambodian Riel.   
  
A small/quaint tree house cafe, Marum is named after the Moringa, which means the Tree of Life. They serve a fusion of Cambodian cuisine. The restaurant falls under the Tree Alliance Group, which dedicate their profits to various social program in Cambodia and train adolescents to become skilled and productive members of the society. You can read more about what they do here:[ ](http://www.tree-alliance.org/index.php)[http://www.tree-alliance.org/index.php](http://www.tree-alliance.org/index.php "http://www.tree-alliance.org/index.php"). They have taken in many at risk kids and taught them tangible skills so that they can make a living in a country where the economy is heavily dependent on tourism.   
  
We braved a super heavy storm on a tuk tuk with minimal windshields to check out this restaurant. It was worth the trip. When we stayed at Viroth's Villa, the tuk tuk took about 15 min to get to Marum.

Egg rolls  
  
â€‹My favorite was the Khmer pork salad. It was spicy but the sourness was just right. The more traditional Khmer dishes tend to be heavy on the flavors, i.e. coconut milk. We ordered a lot of yummy stuff to share. Their menu is in English but you can always ask the waiter to recommend their specials based on seasonal ingredients. All servers come as a pair. There is a student and a teacher. The student will talk about about each of the dish he or she serves in English. If the student is not sure what to do, the teacher will come in and help.  
  
The eggplant dip was almost like an Asian guac and chips, extra spicy++. I think we ordered about 7-8 small dishes total to share between 4 pax. It was definitely way too much food. My mother really loved this restaurant because of its mission to help at risk youth.   
  
We recommend that you come early and sit in their best seats on their small balcony and drink the night away if you are on a romantic getaway. There was a couple chilling there/drinking wine while listening to the sound of the rain falling.
  
They had the best smoothie I had in Cambodia. They have many options for smoothies and you must try them. I almost wanted to order a second one to go.

We came on a weekday during a heavy storm, so not many patrons here yet. I'd recommend bringing some mosquito repellent if you are prone to being bitten.
