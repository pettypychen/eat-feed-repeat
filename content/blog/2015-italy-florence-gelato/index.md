You must have a gelato when you are in Italy. We got a gelato every day. There were just so many shops around. We did our research beforehand and knew that we didn't want to get into tourist traps, so we stayed away from the gelato shops on the main streets (essentially roads that leads to Duomo i.e.Via dei Calzaiuoli). If you look around and you see yourselves surrounded by tourists, then you know whatever you eat there is a) not great and b) â‚¬â‚¬. We usually waited until we were inside of small streets where we see lots of Florentines commuting on bikes before we made our way to the gelato. Stretching our euros real thin. If you are not as adventurous as us, you can always go to Eataly. Eataly has gelato smoothies for â‚¬2.5

Via dei Martelli, 22, 50122 Firenze, Italy.   
This was my favorite place in Florence; therefore, I think it deserves another post.
