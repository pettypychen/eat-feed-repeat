This is one of my favourite baby food meal for baby L. It is so easy to make and mess-free! You can add a soft-boiled egg if you want to make it more nutritious. Tomatoes are optional. 

1. Cut chunks of organic pumpkin and tomato in small pieces and boil them in the water. ![](./boil-pot.png) 
2. Drain the pumpkin and tomato and save some of the water for later. 
3. Put everything in a blender. Add some of the water from the pot to make the purée less dry. ![](./blender.png) 
4. Remove the puree from the blender and you are done!
