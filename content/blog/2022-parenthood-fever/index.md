Sick kids are a common things for parents who send their kids to preschool. Toddler L gets at least 1 URTI (upper respiratory tract illness) AKA the flu every quarter. The flu can typically wipe out her entire class with few kids attending school for the entire week. 

Given tighter COVID measures since 2020, the school would send Toddler L home whenever she has a runny nose or cough. For a 2 yo, she is already familiar with the ART drills. She does the ART willingly and without tears. We tell her that the stick is used to clean her nose like a cotton bud. 

By the way, you should always clean the kid's nose gently with a cotton bud rather than letting the toddler stick a finger up his or her nose. Otherwise, you would end up with a Carrie moment when you are not looking. The Kiesselbach plexus in the nose is very vascular and can easily bleed a lot if your little one has sharp nails. 


## Should I freak out when my kid has fever?

It is common for kids to have a fever. So don't freak out. I am pretty sure every single household post-COVID would have a thermometer at home. The first thing you should always do is to check the temperature. Don't be like one of those parents that comes to the clinic and say... my kid has a fever because he/she feels hot. Then I proceed to check the kid's temperature... and no there is no fever and I send the parents + kid home. 

It does not matter how you do it... in the ear, under the armpit, in the mouth, or up the butt... they all do the same thing... which is measuring the temperature in your little one. 

I chose the tear-free way which is one of those handheld thermometer that uses infrared measured on the forehead. I used to use the in the ear type when I was running clinics but you gotta buy those plastic covers for the thermometer. For a normal day to day temperature check, you don't really need something that professional. 

Anything above 38 C is consider a fever. Don't panic and find your local family doctor if your kid is like 37.5, which I have seen before when I was locuming as a GP. As a parent, you should just remain calm and don't rush to the KKH A&E either for a fever. 

You will thank me because I just saved you a trip that would cost you at least 5 hours in the A&E while waiting for a doctor to see you. KKH is busy and has a lot of actually super sick kids in the A&E. By going there, you just exposed your kid to more germs and viruses that you would otherwise not have been exposed to if you chilled at home. 


## What should you do if you have confirmed that indeed the child has a damn fever

The first thing we do is an ART on my kid when she gets a fever/runny nose/cough. If it is negative, then put a fever patch on the forehead and let her go about her day. If it is positive, well that is COVID for you.

Things that you should not do:
1. **Bring the kid to playground:** I see a lot of parents who bring their sick kids to the playground because the kid cannot go to school. Thanks for spreading germs everywhere to all the healthy kids at the playground. 
2. **Wrap the kid up in 700 layers:** Look I get it. My mother thinks that you get a flu when you don't wear enough clothes or don't blowdry your hair after you shower. I have seen kids who are wrapped in winter clothes in the GP settings... and the parents expect the temperature to go down in Singapore's weather. HELLO! If you are sick and I make you wear a winter coat... do you think your fever will go down? The kid will end up with a heat stroke!!! That poor kid was sweating like mad while coughing away. 
3. **Ask your family medicine doctor for antibiotics:** A flu is viral in nature. You don't need antibiotics. For the longest time, I wanted to slap everyone that came through the door when they ask for antibiotics, because what ends up happening is that I spend 10 min explaining how bacterial infection is different from viral infection and how antibiotcis is meant to treat bacterial infection. You are not getting your money's worth by getting antibiotics from your GP. You are just contributing to the global misuse of antibiotics, which is a huge problem because lots of bacterial infections are now antibiotic resistant. This means that when you are actually sick with a bacterial infection, we have no real medicine to treat you. I am pretty sure no parent would want that for their kid. 
4. **Don't drug your kid:** There is a type of mother that will ask for a gazillion meds for their kid when the kid only has very mild symptoms of the flu. More medicine is not better for your kid. The body can heal itself. It just takes time. Taking more meds is not going to make the flu go away faster. It just masks the symptoms of the body fighting the infection. You still can't make the kid go back to school because it spreads the virus in the classroom. 


## When will the kid ever recover

I work from home so I am familiar with the agony of having a sick kid running around the house while I am on a conference call. The kid will recover within a week. Don't try to send that kid back to school the next day after the fever/runny nose/cough started because you will end up making the rest of the class sick. You know you have done that if there are only 2 kids left in the class after you have sent your kid back to school the next day. You should feel guilty about this because other parents have to go through the exact same shit that you went through. 

Kids are strong and the body can heal itself. Don't try to rush it. 

## When should I be worried?

1. **Febrile seizure:** The kid might have a seizure when the body temperature is super high. A seizure usually consists of eyes uprolling, frothing at the mouth, stiffening and jerking of the upper and lower limbs and loss of consciousness. Most febrile seizures stop spontaneously within 5 minutes and the child regains consciousness thereafter. Bring your kid to KKH or NUH A&E for further evaluation. 
2. **Dehyration and loss of appetite:** Keeping your kid hydrated does not mean fruit juices. The ideal hydration is oral Pedialyte, which gives enough of the right salt in the fluid. My kid gets yogurt, soft boiled egg, and milk when she does not feel like eating. It usually happens on the first few days of the flu and after that she will eat normally again. 
3. **Decrease activity level:** If the kid is really lethargic and is not playing anymore, you should bring the kid to see a pediatrician for further evaluation.
4. **Blisters and weird rashes:** This may not be a normal flu. Let a doctor check it out. 

A fever is part and parcel of a parental's life. Everyone will come out of the other end feeling much better and prepared dealing with the next flu/fever and whatever life throws at you and your little one.
