I have been scaling a human being for the past 9 months and I was ready to drop my single.

**Duration:** 19 hours

**3:20AM:** I woke up in a sweat and I felt the rhythmic
    contraction getting stronger and stronger. This was not a drill.

**4:00AM:** As planned, I ensure I had bowel opening before
    I go to the hospital. The thought of fleet crossed my mind, but I didn’t
    want it.

**4:30AM:** I googled ways to relax before the delivery. I
    knew that I was in phase 1 of labour and it would take anywhere between
    10–24 hours for the little one to arrive. Time to take a warm bath with some
    Epsom salt. This could be the last bath I take for the foreseeable future.
    Better be clean for the mess to come.

**5:00AM:** Yep, I am pretty sure that today was the day. A
    week ago, I was hoping that baby L would arrive early given that my amniotic
    fluid index was borderline low. My womb wanted to evict the little child.
    Plus, I just did not want to count baby kicks anymore. When people talk
    about the last week feeling like forever, I totally get it. It felt like my
    belly would explode at any point in time. The haemorrhoids were real and the
    lower limb swelling was unbearable in the hot humid weather of June in the
    tropics. I slacked my coworkers to let them know that I gotta go to the
    hospital today. Maybe I would have time to set my away message later (I did
    not).

**6:00AM:** I woke my mother up and told her that today was
    the day. The breakfast menu was curry rice. I did not want to go to the
    hospital yet because I knew I was not gonna get any food the moment they
    wheel me (or I walk) into the delivery suite. I get hangry easily. I did not
    want to get hangry on my D-day. I sent A off to work and told him that I
    would call him from the delivery suite if it is for realsies. A was assigned
    to the operating theatre that morning.


**7:00AM:** I washed strawberry and blueberry. I cleaned the
    house… in case I was not coming back for a few days. I needed fruits to keep
    me going. The contraction was 15 minutes apart lasting 30 sec each. It was
    not time yet. Time to pack my hospital bag.

**8:05AM:** Thank goodness I decided to put on a pad. Bloody
    show! I am totally a textbook case of normal delivery.

**8:30AM:** Time for a nap. I have been up for like 5 hours!
    Ops, felt a leak of fluid. I called Grab. The contraction started to get
    painful.

**9:05AM:** Another gush of fluid… I was pretty sure that my
    water bag broke. My lovely husband arranged for his colleague to take over
    his work and magically showed up at the door of the delivery suite just
    before the water bag broke.

**9:15AM:** I finally made it to the delivery suite! Horray!
    12 more hours to go.

**9:45AM-11AM:** Nitrous oxide gas… oh… it did not help with
    the pain. My contraction was erratic and my pain score escalated from 6–9/10
    within 30 min. The side effect of giddiness from Entonox was not pleasant. I
    was practically Darth Vader breathing under my breath every time the nurse
    asked me to repeat my identification number.

**11:30AM:** Like always, the anaesthetist saves the day.
    Epidural was invented because labour is painful. I have suffered enough at
    that point. There was no way that I am doing this all natural.

**12:30PM:** Super itchy! The side effect of fentanyl. I had
    rashes all over my body. I could not stop myself from scratching until my
    skin bleeds.

**1:00PM:** Woot! 3 cm dilation of the cervix. We took a
    selfie to celebrate the last few hours of A and me together as a family unit
    of 2.

**3:45PM:** Ops too much oxytocin. Baby had a deceleration
    for her heartbeat. Time to dial it back to zero. A dose of salbutamol to
    reverse the synto drip caused my heart to beat faster than normal. I was
    cover in my own sweat/blood. So glad that I took that bath. Still, super
    drowsy…tried to read emails… failed. Dozed off.

**6:00PM:** 7cm dilation! I was cheering my cervix on. 1 cm
    per hour… I should be delivering by 9PM. My in-laws would be landing in 2
    more hours while my mother waiting outside of the delivery suite.

**7:00PM:** I knew that I was nil-by-mouth, but I begged the
    nurse to let me buy some sour patch kids. Don’t laugh. You know you love the
    sourness when you stuff these candies into your cheeks. My only meal for the
    day was the curry rice… damn it… I should have eaten more in the
    morning.

**7:20PM:** A came in with my sour patch kids. I happily
    chewed it until I extracted all the sugar content then waited for the
    gelatin bits to melt in my mouth.

**7:45PM:** Ok, it was probably a bad idea to drink so much
    fluid. I vomited twice all over myself.

**8:00PM:** A went to get his parents. I had a weird bout of
    shivering. Apparently, it is due to the adrenaline rush that I am getting to
    prepare to delivery the bebe.

**8:15PM:** 10 cm! Cervix is ready to go. How about the
    passenger? Well, the baby was still at station 0. Time for nap while I wait
    for the baby to move down.

**8:45 PM:** A nurse came in to check on me. Bebe moved down
    slightly. Get ready to push anytime when I feel the contraction. Being on
    epidural was a weird sensation. I could feel the weight of my feet but I
    could not feel pain. I could feel the bebe pressing against my cervix. The
    nurse went through 2 practice runs with me to push.

**9:00PM:** My gynae came back after dinner. It was a long
    day for everyone in the delivery suite. My classmate, nurses, and other
    doctors were running around like crazy the whole day given that 6/6 was an
    auspicious day and the delivery suite was full.

**9:00–10:00PM:** I push and push and push and push… in the
    wrong direction for the first 30 min. The effort was wasted because the
    bebe’s head was not moving down. My gynae was worried that I had maternal
    exhaustion. Well, I was pretty tired… not fed…partially covered in blood and
    some remnant of my own vomit. It was totally not glam. I vomited 3 more
    times during the last phase of my labour. My vomiting speed was so fast that
    the nurse could not get the vomit bag next to my mouth in time. Sorry… gotta
    get another gown. I never cried because I knew that it was a waste of an
    effort. I remembered the days that I spent in the labour ward. The mother
    who cried/kicked/shouted ended up wasting a lot more energy and often had to
    go for cesareans because they tired themselves out. I was quietly pushing as
    hard as I could.

**Finally, a bébé was born.**
