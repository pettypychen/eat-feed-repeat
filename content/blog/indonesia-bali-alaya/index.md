Alaya Resort was a lush greenery in Ubud. We were close to the rice paddies. Compared to the seaside luxury at Seminyak, Ubud is more a simple heaven away from hustle and bustle of the city life. Alaya is close to many yoga studios and is central to the Ubud town center (within 20-30 min walking distance). The walk from Alaya to Ubud palace is full of Balinese boutique shops. The breakfast offered at Alaya was basic +. If you want to try out the farm to table concept, look no further than the [Locavore](http://hola-yolo.weebly.com/food/locavore-to-go). We did not try the massage at Alaya, so no review for their service. If it was sunny, we would have just chilled by their pool for the whole morning. I did love the sense of calm we got from the town. Alaya is a comfortable resort with a rain bath shower. Given the central location of the resort, it is definitely a convenient option for those who prefer to live close to the tourist attractions.
