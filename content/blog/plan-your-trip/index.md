We always plan our trips before we go. I am super OCD so whenever I travel I always use an excel sheet to help me manage meals, check-in/out details, and programs that I have to attend.

## **Set a budget**

A budget is important. Stick to it. Be reasonable. Know roughly how much things costs.

* **Airfare:** People say buy your tickets 3 months in advance so you can get the best deal. I don't really believe in such a thing. Most of the time, I don't have the luxury to wait until the price drops before I book my tickets. Remember to clear your cache if you checked out some tickets a few days ago. Airlines have cookies that can detect you as a potential buyer and bump up those ticket prices that you have been eyeing for the last 48 hours. Incognito mode on Chrome allows you to avoid this.
* **Hotel:** For a safe bet, go with the conventional hotel chains. The downside is a bazillion tourist. If you want a different experience, you can go for AirBnB. Boutique hotels are nice, especially in Thailand.
* **Meals:** For good food, check out local blogs!
* **Gifts:** I don't really buy souvenirs anymore. 10 years ago, I used to buy something for everyone. I think nowadays, you can online shop for everything. There isn't much of a point in buying useless key chains, cups, T-shirts, and photo frames.
* **Emergency funds:** As a habit, we always save S$50 in case we need emergency funds (need a cab/hungry).

## **Exchange money**

Some countries offer better exchange rates at the airport (i.e. Thailand) versus others who don't. Know the current exchange rate. We usually just google. Bloomberg is also pretty good. If you are exchanging a small amount, you can do it at a money exchanger. We usually use Arcade money exchanger at Raffles Place.

* Always count your own money before you head to the money exchanger.
* Confirm the exchange rate with the people running the money exchanger.
* Once you get your money, double-check!
* Ask for some small bills in case you need them for bus rides.

For larger amounts, some people prefer to use their debit cards and withdraw money at their destination. The bank to bank exchange rate is better than any money exchangers in the world. I have never tried it.

## **Do your homework.**

My fianc√© and I usually split the tasks up. He would surf TripAdvisor looking for things to do and places to eat. I like to look for local blogs. Not all the restaurants that tourists rave about on TripAdvisor are as good as they sound or look. The moral of the story is to cross-reference all reviews. We love eating and so we really go the extra mile to get the best things on our plates. I am a firm believer that not all expensive things taste good and not all cheap food tastes crappy. Do yo research!
