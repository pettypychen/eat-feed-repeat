**Bruschetta:** The candied tomatoes came with bruschetta that looked like tortilla chips but was very fluffy/crispy at the same time. It was difficult to explain. Not sure how I felt about the dish.   
  
**Wagyu Shabu Shabu:** Wasabi Gnocchi, HIJIKI, Dashi, White radish. The dashi is very sweet. The soup was distilled in the flask and was left alone to condense back to liquid form. The most tasty creation of science I have ever had.   
  
**Singapore Caesar Salad:** Cos Lettuce, Parmesan Cheese, Bakkwa, Thai basil, Olive oil. I never eat salad with dressings but this salad was so good that I didn't leave any leftover. The bakkwa was an interesting twist though.

**Lewin Spice Lamb:** Grilled Lamb, Red cabbage pickle, mix herbs Kanzuri (Spicy Condiment), Balsamic reduction. Tender lamb with no gaminess.

**Alaskan Lobster Bisque:** The bisque was slightly on the thicker side. It went well with the lobster but if it were just a bisque on its own it may be too heavy. The petals were edible as well.

**Kyoho white grape wine:** This was my favorite item from dinner. I could drink this pseudo moscato all day long.A great ending to a long year. |
