ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­ **Phuket, Thailand**

It is difficult to find this place. I highly recommend hiring a cab driver and just tell him to drop you off at the door. It is in a Sino-Portuguese house near Old Phuket Town.   
  
**Address:** 48 Dibuk Rd, Phuket Town, Phuket, Thailand  
**Telephone:** +66 76 21 8155  
**Opening Hours:**  
The cab driver said between lunch and dinner hours. Just remember to check with your hotel frontdesk to see if they are open on the day you plan to visit  
**Recommendation:** âœ©âœ©âœ©âœ©âœ©   
**Cost:** à¸¿â€‹à¸¿  
  
The decor of the place is charming. According to the locals, this is one of the best places to eat in Phuket for traditional Thai cuisine. Some Thai celebrities used to drive from Bangkok all the way down to Phuket just to eat here. Zero Thai celebrity sighting while we were there (thunderstorm weather).

Complimentary mango

One word: delicious. If I had 2 stomachs, I think I would have filled it with another plate of the Thai red curry. The pad see ew is on the more acidic side (due to the fresh lemon juice). I am usually allergic to preservatives in prawns, so I can guarantee that these shrimps are definitely preservative free. Mango were not in season when we went to Phuket. Raya had the mango sticky rice, but we were too full from lunch so we did not try them.
