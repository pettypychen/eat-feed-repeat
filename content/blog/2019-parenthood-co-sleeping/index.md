## My thoughts on co-sleeping

Despite Asian people having strong co-sleeping culture, A & I did not want baby L kicking us in the face in the middle of the night. I was brought up co-sleeping with my parents and my mother is still a huge advocate for such sleeping arrangement, BUT it is not recommended by health professionals to co-sleep with your baby because of the risk of suffocation and frankly, you crushing your baby in your sleep. 

I love cuddling my baby. But for safety reasons, we do not co-sleep and share a bed. Skin-to-skin should be done when you are awake. I do understand that sometimes you are just so tired that you accidentally fall asleep with the baby on you but try to make the effort of putting the baby back to his or her own bed. It is hard to know what will happen to the baby when you doze off. The internet is full of horror stories of moms waking up noticing the baby's nose was covered or the baby slipped down when the mom fell asleep. 

Some people opt for a crib that can be folded down on one side so you can see your baby in the middle of the night. This arrangement is perfectly fine.

[Finnish babies sleep in a box](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22751415) and they have one of the lowest rates of infant mortality. A box is definitely the cheapest option for a baby crib. Obviously, don't put the box (if you are gonna get one) on the floor because you could trip and fall in the middle of the night while trying to get to your baby.

## Safe sleeping practice

[American Academy of Pediatrics](https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/Pages/American-Academy-of-Pediatrics-Announces-New-Safe-Sleep-Recommendations-to-Protect-Against-SIDS.aspx) recommends the following for safe sleeping arrangement with your bebe: 


* Place the baby on his or her back on a firm sleep surface such as a crib or bassinet with a tight-fitting sheet.
* Avoid the use of soft bedding, including crib bumpers, blankets, pillows and soft toys. 
* The crib should be bare.
* Share a bedroom with parents, but not the same sleeping surface, preferably until the baby turns 1 but at least for the first six months. Room-sharing decreases the risk of SIDS by as much as 50 percent.
* Avoid baby's exposure to smoke, alcohol and illicit drugs.
