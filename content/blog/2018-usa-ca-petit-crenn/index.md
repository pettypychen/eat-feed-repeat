It was lovely being back in the Bay. I have always loved the slightly salty air that brought a sense of comfort. During college, I did not go home very frequently so I always missed the scent associated with the bay (if you live there long enough, you'll know what I am talking about). I guess given my complicated origin story, I will always consider the Bay as my hometown. It felt super weird seeing a huge part of S.F. getting gentrified. We loved the hipster shops but did not like the price tag on everything. Anyways, I digress so let's bring the focus back to the lovely restaurant that was the highlight of my S.F. trip.

Petit Crenn is chef Dominique Crenn's cozy, modern French bistro for all-day menus. We loved the hip atmosphere of the bistro, which is located in the smack center of Mission District.   
  
Chef Crenn has another two Michelin starred restaurant- Atelier Crenn in S.F., which will definitely be on the "to eat" list next time we are back.   
  
Parking is always a b^@#$@ in S.F, so I would suggest either taking a Uber or public transportation + walk (calf strengthening exercises).   
  
I would say book early if you want to go. Although the restaurant was not packed, they did not accept walk-ins. So far, my experiences with Michelin recommended restaurant has been dismal, so I was really hoping for an excellent meal and that is exactly what I got from Petit Crenn. The portions were just right. After having like humongous portions of food for 1 week+, it was a welcoming change.

Mushroom Tartine. Espelette Aioli. Pickles. Crispy Garlic. Omg. This was finger licking good. The mushroom was unbelievably fresh (Trust me on this, I took a mycology class in college and we used to cook freshly picked wild mushrooms in the forest during class). The seasoning was just right. Unfortunately, none of us really like aioli so we just left it on the side.

Cauliflower Gratin. GruyÃ¨re Cream. Bread Crumb. The GruyÃ¨re melted in your mouth the moment you bite it. It was not overpowering. Just the right amount of cheese. The bread crumbs were actually made in the style of petit choux. Very innovative and very tasty.

Specials for the day: King Salmon Tartare + Onions, Chives, Cucumbers, and Creme Fraiche. One of the best tartare that I had ever. Some places underseason their tartare and if the fish is not fresh then it is super obvious. The Creme Fraiche was true to its name- fresh and clean.

Petit Crenn Omelette. Fines Herbes. The eggs had just a small hint of sardines cooked with it. The dish was very similar to Japanese tamago but with a Western twist.

Paris-Brest: PralinÃ¨ Mousse. Orange Caramel. Candied Hazelnuts. You have to get this. I can't think of any words to describe it because it was just super delicious.

  
â€‹The service was amazing (the server kept wiping the table in between every course). The atmosphere was quaint. The food was solid given the price. I would highly recommend this place.
