This cute little french cafÃ© was the last place that I visited before I left Singapore in 2017. I am beginning to miss the scorching sun because it is really too cold here. It is currently 7 C outside with the lowest of 4 C. I literally feel like I am severely overdressed in terms of layers here compare to some of the residents. I know I should not be complaining because my brother lives in Rochester, MN and it is currently -1 C there and can get down to -22 C by next week. Brrr cold. I kind of miss wearing long sleeves again but I don't miss the layering and how heavy it gets wearing many many layers. Winter clothes are surprisingly heavy. I wonder why my younger self never thought much about it. Dressing for work used to be super easy in Singapore because I'll just put on one of my many dresses and I am good to go (it is like a uniform). Now it actually takes time to coordinate my top and pants (mostly my activewears). You should check out this video to get a sense of what I have been doing most days in my activewear ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYRENWT8lz8) here).   
  
I am dedicating more time to blogging so I am catching up all of the blog posts that I never got to when I was working in Singapore. Back to talking about Merci Marcel. Tiong Bahru Bakery is right next to this place so I was pretty curious how this shop can compete with the "Best French Bakery in Singapore" (I did not say this, it is TBB's tag-line on google). TBB has some sweet chocolate croissants that make you feel like you have lost half of your workout. To compare, we ordered a Merci's croissant to see whether it stands the test. Frankly speaking, it was like 2PM and we weren't that hungry so we got a snack.   
  
Well, that sweet croissant was pretty damn good. A said it was like eating in a French cafÃ© in France (super buttery), so we give it a thumb up for things to try in Tiong Bahru.

I got some freshly squeezed orange juice. I am pretty sure they squeezed it because they took the oranges in front of me.   
  
Looking at their menu, they serve very simple homey food with wine pairing. I always trusts french people's taste in wine. We will come back here for a proper meal next time!

Extra sitting in the back of the shophouse. Lots of plants to make it feel like it is open-air.

Eclectic, yet charming graphic designs. Totally gots the hipster feel down to a T.   
  
On a side note, I don't like writing about places that frequently go to in Singapore (for example, many places in the Outram area). A said it is selfish because I like to keep the places that I love to myself. I guess to me it is a bit weird to blog about places that I go so frequently because I pretty much know the cashier or the owner and they know my orders! I have been eating at this one hawker stall for 6 1/2 years (now a restaurant). A and I are both friends with the chef and will chat to see how he and his wife/kid are doing. I will tell you that there are a bunch of french bakery, restaurant, book, and grocery store in Tiong Bahru and leave it for the reader to figure out which ones I am talking about. I think the fun of going to Tiong Bahru is to get lost in the small alleys and check out the new hipster shops.   
  
Back to the post, so Merci Marcel is the sort of place that has avocado toasts ("the sustenance for all millennials other than RosÃ©") that will cost you, your future flat. I am gonna leave with the thought of: I get the appeal for bellini but not so much for RosÃ© (perhaps it is because it is pink?).
