â€‹Murdita (The Assistant Manager) brought out the food. He also asked how we liked the food. He seemed happy that we thought the food was excellent. 

* Juice of the Day (Mango) and Ice Black Coffee
* Soup of the Day- pumpkin with wholewheat bread (freshly baked)
* Korean Style Burger +â€‹Pommes DauphineBrioche bun, local Wagyu patty, homemade kimchi, Hoisin sauce, iceberg lettuce, spicy mayonnaise (on the side). The star of the dish is the pommes dauphine. It is fried mashed potatoes. I don't know how they manage to get them so crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. All the ingredients are so fresh! 
* Burger A La Rayâ€‹Brioche bun, local Wagyu patty, pickled zucchini, homemade tomato ketchup, local cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, crispy homemade bacon, iceberg lettuce. You can eat all 3 meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) at Locavore. I highly recommend this place for casual dining.
