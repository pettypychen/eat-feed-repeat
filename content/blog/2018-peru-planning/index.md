ðŸ‡µðŸ‡ª **Peru**

I am excited! A & I planned our spring break. 

Never thought that I would say this about traveling but certain Wonders of the World is really pain in the *butt* to get to due to logistic difficulties, so I am hoping all these tedious planning will pay off instead of a tourist ripoff waiting for me on the other side. Not sure if it is the monday morning blues talking or just general negativity from the pouring rain outside. I am gonna blame it on the rain. 

Yes, Pinterest pictures make it so enticing that you are like OMG I must go to Machu Picchu before I die. I know I am a bit young to be doing bucket list but hey why not! 

Total amount of planning time for Machu Picchu ~ 2-3 weeks. I started with some casual browsing of things to do in Peru > look up how to get to Machu Picchu > look up restaurants > set-up a tentative itinerary > proposed the itinerary and the suggested budget to A > refine the itinerary to cut down on the cost > book everything. 

I think no one ever tells you how many different modes of transportation you need to get to Machu Picchu so I am gonna break it down for you: 

SFO > Lima via flight
Travel time: 11-15 hours of flight usually with 1-2 layovers
Buy it online
Lima > Cusco via flight
Travel time: 1 hour +/- 30 min
Buy it online
Cusco > Ollantaytambo via bus 
Travel time: ~2 hours +/- traffic
I am fortunate enough to get the bimodal ticket which includes the bus + train. If you don't have that option then you either book a cab or take a bus to Ollantaytambo train station. 
Ollantaytambo > Aguas Caliente via train
Travel time: ~1 hour 40 min
Buy it via PeruRail or IncaRail
Aguas Caliente > Machu Picchu via bus
Travel time: 30 min (excluding the time spent on buying bus tickets)
Buy it there 

Err, don't try to drive from Lima to Cusco (google map). The driving will probably take up one day of your trip. 

Most people probably book the trip with some travel agency to just save themselves the headache of coordination but I thought I have the time so I would rather plan my trip myself (retrospectively speaking, maybe I should have chosen a place that is slightly easier to get to).

Disclaimer: I am not a master at planning trips, but I am very OCD about it and I shop for hours for good deals.

Machu Picchu Entry Ticket
The best site that I found that helped me through the process was this website: https://thriftynomads.com/how-to-buy-machu-picchu-tickets-online/ . It has screenshots. You can also use google translate! My high school Spanish teacher should be proud of my bare minimum Spanish skills that got me through the whole process of booking things online!

The very very OCD travel schedule that I planned.

Lessons that I have learned
1. Don't try book things in the middle of the night
A & I started to book all of the transportation + hotels at 9PM and we were 90% done at 12:30AM. 
We made a few mistakes here and there. For example, I accidently booked the wrong date for one of the hotels but thank goodness it was a free cancellation before ____ date. 
2. Open all of the various things that you need to book (ex: hotel, transportation, Machu Picchu entry tickets) in tabs first before you start booking.
You don't want to end up with a flight that has no connection to a bus or a train. Look at the train schedule to Machu Picchu > the bus schedule > local flight > international flight. It was a lot of looking back and forth because we are super anal. 
3. Certain computers and browsers can actually hike up your hotel price. The hotel industries track your cookies (not the real cookies but internet cookies) so make sure you clear your browsers before you start the booking process (read more about it here). 
We used two computers and one phone to triple check the prices to make sure that we do have the lowest price on the hotels. 
You can also try to check different dates, because we have saved about $200-400 from a hotel before by moving the dates to weekday.  
My computer was giving higher prices for the accomodations! I think it is because I have been browsing about Peru for a month and somehow the internet knows that. Do know that your track records for online shopping can skew the prices that the online websites offer you for your accommodations. Be a cheapo so that the prices they offer you is lower (but don't be a cheapo for Airbnb though, see my previous post about people trying to haggle Airbnb price). 
4. Double and triple check your details before you buy. 
A and I use a common technique in medicine to verify our details: we read back to check to make sure that the dates and personal details are accurate to avoid problems later on. Some flights won't let you get on if there is a misspelling on your ticket and you will have to pay to change the name!

I am pretty sure there were other lessons that I have learned but I'll save it for later. Gotta get to my monday morning stretch yoga class so will update this post again once I have gone on my trip to let you know more about the logistics of getting to Machu Picchu.
