## 1. Bottles  
Do not buy a bunch of bottles in advance. Each baby has their own preferences, so it's best to adjust once the baby arrives. For example, Lucy liked different bottles compared to Lila.  

## 2. Milk Powder  
It's good to have some milk powder on standby, especially for the first pregnancy, as milk supply might not be sufficient initially. You can sign up for free samples to test different brands before committing to a large purchase. However, avoid letting the baby rely too much on formula, as it is sweeter than breastmilk and can make breastfeeding more challenging.  

## 3. Nursing Pillow  
Getting the baby to latch properly can be difficult. Many "cute" nursing pillows fail to provide adequate head support. Instead, a long body pillow with additional support from other pillows works better. I wasted money on a nursing pillow and ended up using a flexible body pillow the most while breastfeeding.  

## 4. Pump + Bra  
Check if your insurance covers a breast pump. If you are only planning on having one child, consider renting a pump instead of buying one.  

## 5. Bed  
Skip the baby bassinet. They are generally not safe. Instead, invest in a larger crib that can be adjusted into a toddler bed.  

## 6. Stroller  
If you drive regularly, you likely won't need a stroller.  

## 7. Baby Car Seat  
This is where you should invest your money. Get the safest car seat with the highest safety ratings.  

## 8. Hot Water Bottle Dispenser  
A hot water dispenser is better than an electric bottle warmer, which can overheat milk. You can also use it for making formula beyond the breastfeeding period.  

## 9. Wipes  
Instead of buying disposable wipes, purchase around 24 small cotton face towels. They work great for wiping the baby and as burp cloths. They are easy to wash and save a lot of money.  

## 10. Muslin Cloths  
These were useless for my kids—they never wanted to be wrapped in them. Now, they use them for indoor camping.  

## 11. Pacifiers  
Do not buy a box of pacifiers. None of my kids wanted them.  

## 12. Prioritize Mom’s Comfort  
Most of your budget should go towards ensuring the mom's comfort. Babies are resilient and adapt to almost anything. A happy mom = a happy baby.
