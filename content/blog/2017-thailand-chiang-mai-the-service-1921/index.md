It has been a tough week, so I figure writing about food usually helps with my mood. It helps to bring back great memories from last month.   
  
The Service 1921 is spy themed restaurant nested in the Anantara Resort. â€‹Anantara has more of a resort vibe. You definitely see peeps chilling around the pool. "The name is Bond, James Bond." That is right! All of their drinks are named after James Bond movies. We got a goldfinger from the secret services menu.   
  
Their menu comes in the form of a manila folder, so be ready for your next secret mission. JK, the mission is to pick your dinner. There are lots of dishes to choose from so be sure your partner and you are on the same page (pun intended).

Organic Lanna style fried chicken- omg, you have to get this dish. The outside of the chicken was so crispy but the inside was full of moist juicy meat. This is worth a repeat.

Antipasto Poo Nim Klug Nga- Lanna style crab with slightly herbal but sweat/sour sauce. It goes really well with white rice.

Pad Thai- The Tiger prawns are excellent. Look at the egg. it is perfectly fried and wraps around the noodle. It was delicious! 

Overall, I really loved my meal at The Service. Gotta thank A for the last minute pick. The atmosphere was good, the food was great, and the company was amazing. Love it!
