It has been a while since I wrote about parenthood and I am sure people are curious what happened to me. I was pretty much MIA for the entire year until the Parents in Tech [podcast](https://www.parents.fm/episode/baby-tech-quality-time-and-asking-for-help-with-dr-petty-chen) in Jan.

1. I got a new job as the director of medical products so pretty much was fighting fire for the first 6 months into the job. The usual... finding directions for the team, mentoring new PMs, and doings loads of BD engagement.
2. Baby L was stable and growing so there was nothing much to write about... until now.

## What the f\*\$^p are the terrible twos?

"The term "terrible twos" has long been used to describe the changes that parents often observe in 2 year-old children. A parent may perceive this age as terrible because of the rapid shifts in a child's mood and behaviors ‚Äî and the difficulty of dealing with them. One minute your child might be clinging to you and the next he or she is running in the opposite direction."

My docile little girl all the sudden was like a Godzilla.

1. No dress = meltdown
2. Not her favorite spoon = meltdown
3. Going to school = meltdown and not going to school = meltdown

I have never felt so tired in baby L's short existence of life.

## Struggling for power

I have always been someone who needs a lot of control in life. I have not met my match in any power struggle... until now! My little girl is the mirror image of me in terms of temperament. I can see how I can be irritatingly stubborn.

I think the hardest part of the terrible twos is Jedi mind tricking your own child so that the meltdown seems like it never happened. Distraction worked when the terrible twos started. She wanted a dress so I would let her pick another colored shirt and explain to her that wearing a dress to the playground would make her butt hurt if she were to go down a slide. It is a wonder that simple logic worked on my own kid.

I can tell you what did not work: sitting in silence with my kid for 30 mins for something that she did. She refused to apologize and I refused to forgive her, so we both sat in silence in the dark. I was too angry to turn on the lights. But we forgave each other when she got scared and put her hand in my hand. She eventually did say sorry. See, I tell you I always win in a stubborn match. #winner

Sarcasm aside, my kid constantly felt like she needs to exert power and as a parent, I constantly felt the need to tell her that sometimes her demands were just unreasonable. If I asked "why?" enough times, she would sometimes forget what she asked for. #jedimindtrick

## Sleep regression

This went on for ~2.5 months. She was sleeping for the entire night until she was like 2y3m into her terrible twos. It was probably my fault though. I tried to create more space in my home office now that I have been working from home for close to 6 months, so we rearranged the furniture and adjusted baby L's room. She started running out of her bed at 2-3AM and asking us to stay with her.

It started with just 10 min with her. It became 1 hour. Then it became me falling asleep at 3AM after struggling to put her to bed and waking up at 5AM to sneak out of her room. You get the idea. We did not stick with our usual "Nope, not staying in your room strategy" that has worked so well thus far. It was a slippery slope. A was more tired than being on call because baby L would wake up at 2, 4, and 6 AM.

I don't know what worked but any of the following could have contributed to her reverting back to sleeping the entire night again:

1. Pushing bedtime back by 1 hour
2. Put up rails again in her crib (ha, now let's see how you escape at night!)

- To my surprise... her upper body strength allowed her to escape... she just can't see very well and she is worried she will fall

3. Quiet time for the hour before bedtime
4. Gave her one additional teddy bear for night time
5. Create a pillow fort next to her crib so she feels safe
6. Cut down on her nap night on the weekends when she is at home... oh she got real pissed about this one
7. Not laying on the guest bed anymore when we sing her lullabies
8. Hide on the floor so she cannot see me when she is sleeping

Despite all of this, I got real fed up one day at 4 AM so I just told baby L that if she did not want to sleep then she could get up and clean the apartment. #notaperfectparent

After that incident, I just started to find more and more excuse to go out of her room when she said she needed me. I was sitting outside of her door.Eventually I got tired of that. I just went to bed and told her to sit down when she tried to get up at night via a microphone.

She woke up the next day and told me that I was in the microphone. After that she started to sleep through the night again. Honestly, I don't know what worked. It is a mystery till this date.

## Teething

Imagine my horror when I found a piece of crayon in my kid's mouth. I made her brush her teeth and gurgle. Did you know that the high wax content of crayon makes it a laxative like consuming large quantities of Haribo gummies? My own mother comforted me by telling me that she was too busy to watch me when I was two, so who knows what I ate when she was not looking. Toddler L (she is not really a baby anymore) has been teething but she doesn't say anything. I keep finding chewed up toys everywhere.

I have not found a solution yet. Last night I gave her a pacifier and A totally disagreed with this approach. I ordered a teething toy today. I just hope that it does not arrive after her molar comes out. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## Is there an end for terrible twos?

I don't know. Toddler L has not turned 3 yet. I'll let you know when I get there.
