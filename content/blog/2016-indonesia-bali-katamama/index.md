Get ready for a long post! [Katamama](www.katamama.com) is where A & I stayed on our mini-vacation in Bali. A brought up the idea of going to Bali about 4 years ago. I have always vetoed the idea because I did not like Indo food that much in Singapore. Thailand has always been the first choice for a mini getaway. Well, Bali totally changed my perception of Indo food.

When I was looking up places to stay in Bali, I realized that Bali is actually huge! In the end, we chose to stay in Seminyak and Ubud. Seminyak is known for boutique shops and hipster cafe (right up A's alley). However, we were also able to find some really excellent restaurants in Seminyak.

Katamama has very stringent security checks at the entrance, probably to prevent people from bringing drugs into The Potato Head Beach Club. For the hotel guests, they will drive you in via their goft cart through the boardwalk. I prefer to walk the boardwalk because it is gorgeous!

â€‹It is a boutique hotel made by artisans. According to their brochure, every detail has been handmade or hand-picked, using Indonesia's traditions interpreted in a modern and timeless context. They are going for the understated luxury vibe. Even the bricks came from handmade Balinese bricks. The architect Andra Matin designed the hotel with over 1.5 million bricks. The floors are all a mixture of two terrazzo (native to Bali) to create intricate small triangle patterns.

[Akademi ](http://www.katamama.com/en/neighbourhood/akademi)is the â€˜centre of mixologyâ€™ was launched by award-winning mixologist Dre Masso. It is located right at the entrance of Katamama.

^ Our welcome cocktails. Their staff came into our room and mixed our drinks for us. It was smooth and refreshing. I am a super lightweight, so A had to help me finish it.  
â€‹  
One of the benefits of traveling during the rainy season is a hotel upgrade. Katamama's manager was very kind and upgraded us to the island suite. The service was impeccable. Check-in was done in our suite with a tour of the amenities available inside of the suite. What I loved about their service was that they are really there to make sure you enjoyed your experience/not overly attentive to you.

â€‹The suite has an in-room bar designed by Akademi, complete with an ice well, a recipe book, and a full-sized selection of fine infused spirits, natural syrups, and aromatic bitters for you to experiment with various cocktails that Potato Head is famous for.

I think my jaw dropped when I saw how gorgeous the bathroom was. It is all open concept and it is connected to the main suite via a gigantic wooden door. It has his and her sinks and comes with a bathtub/rain bath as well. Lush greenery is right outside of the window. You may want to lower the blinds (automatic switch) if you feel too self-conscious.

## The Breakfast

* **Merah-** Strawberry, mangosteen, dragon fruit, hibiscus, grape, beetroot, watermelon, and apple slow pressed juice. Yes, you should try this!
* **Pan Catalan-** Organic Heirloom tomatoes with Jamon Serrano on sourdough toast. This was also amazingly delicious. The sweetness of the tomatoes went well with the Jamon Serrano.
* **Huevos Revueltos-** Scrambled free range eggs with soft shell crab and grilled asparagus on toasted sourdough. I got this 2 days in a row. The soft shell crab is soft but crunchy.
* **1/2 portion of Churros-** Spanish Donuts with a rich drinking Flores chocolate 65%. This is by far my favorite Churros that I have eaten. I have eaten a lot of Churros in California, but they are always too sweet for me. This is a more refined Churros in my opinion. The chocolate is smooth and def not bitter.  
  (Lower right) Mocktail Coco Loco- coconut water/flesh with citrus. A was like let's have mocktail for breakfast, so I was like okay why not since I love coconut so much. The clean crisp feel of coco loco really makes you feel that you truly left all your toxins at home.

We are consistently the early-birds for breakfast. I guess no one wakes up at 7+AM on their holidays.

**Verdict for breakfast included by hotel stay:** âœ©âœ©âœ©âœ©  
This is one of the best breakfasts I had at a hotel, on par with Trisara.

Katamama has a small pool and a gym. Their staff also plans yoga by the pool, chocolate tasting, and other cultural activities for you to do at Katamama. My opinion is that I don't really care much for the pool when you have the ocean/beach! You see some people chilling on the side. Most guests would probably head to Potato Club for their infinity pool. One week before our stay, they sent their activities schedule to us and asked if we were keen to participate (considerate +++). The weather was not great when we were there, but it was the perfect weather for getting some zzz and just chillax.

## The Neighbourhood

ZOMG. There are 4 little shops along the boardwalk. When you walk out of the Katamama front door, there is Escalier which sells atas (fancy) beachwear. [1/15 coffee ](http://www.katamama.com/en/neighbourhood/one-fifteen-coffee)smells great but we never tried it as MoVida is providing our caffeine fix. [Alchemy ](http://alchemybali.com/)is the organic deli. They sell raw food (aka non-processed food). Everything looks delicious but we did not get a chance to try it too because we left the hotel too early (they open at 9AM) to roam around. [Canaan ](http://www.katamama.com/en/neighbourhood/canaan)sells home decor made via sustainable practices. Their items looked simple but are actually more of a understated sophistication.

## The Potato Head Beach Club

It opens at 10AM, so the security guy was following me around while I was taking pictures before they were officially open. The draw is the infinity pool. This is the only way to access the beach. Our romantic walk on the beach at night ended in the pouring rain (chuckle). The alcohols are great. We ate at Kaum (more about it on the food blog). Not really my kind of crowd. A said it is more mainstream than hipster, I would agree with him.

Would I come back? YES!

I love the boutique feel of the hotel. I love their management staff. I broke my contact lens on day 1 in Bali. The manager on duty that day helped me called Seminyak Mall to see if they sell contact lenses. They gave us some good luck bracelets when we departed (you know you need to be #blessed for calls).
