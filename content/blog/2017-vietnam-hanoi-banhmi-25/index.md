A blast from the past! This banh mi costs $1.2 SGD or $1 USD and you have to try it if you are in Hanoi. The baguette is so fresh and crispy, but you gotta eat it while it is hot though. We had this banh mi 3 days in a row (even packed it for the flight home). The ingredient was fresh. You see backpackers lining up at 10AM for a light breakfast. Unlike some of the other banh mi places, Banh MÃ¬ 25 had a small sitting area for the guests. You can chill there and people watch or not (the air pollution was pretty bad when we were in Hanoi, so we try to stay indoor as much as possible) . It beats any sandwich place that we had any day. If you are worried about eating street food, don't worry this place is clean. I wished I could have packed 10 of these bad boys back home.
