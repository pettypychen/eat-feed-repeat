This is my last post for 2017 (California time) and the first post for 2018 (Taipei time). I was looking through my photo from 2017 and I realized that I am behind in my blog writing. I guess my wish for 2018 is to write more blog posts, especially for the MAKE section. A asked me why I don't post all of my homemade food on the blog. Well, I usually forgot to take pictures (too hangry) + night time lighting for photo is just crappy so nothing looks good despite the fact that it may taste amazeballs (yes that is a word).   
  
When we went to Napa, we decided to stay in an Airbnb. The property is a small cottage off of the main building. Victoria is a superhost with lots of shining reviews so we were pretty confident that this Airbnb experience would be better than our last Airbnb experience (Florence). For those who have never tried Airbnb, there is some basic etiquette that one should take note of before you check-in.   
  
1\. Airbnb is not a hotel. Don't expect hotel level services. Think of it as couch surfing at your distant relative's home.   
2\. Always be kind to your host. They put in a lot of effort to rearrange their schedules so that they can check you in. Don't demand to check in early (usually they may have another guest before you and they need to buffer in 1+ hours for cleaning). Don't check in at twilight hours. Again, this is not a hotel. Do you expect your distant relative to stay up and open the door for you at 2AM? Probably no, so don't ask your host to do that.   
3\. Keep the bed clean and don't eat in the bed. This is the host's home. If you leave a mess, it will take a few hours for them to clean it up.   
4\. Find out about parking and how to check in early. Don't just randomly park in the middle of nowhere. Your host's family may need the parking spot as well.   
5\. Bring your own toiletries and towels (when you can).  
6\. Text them one day before, the day of arrival, and the day of checking out. Good communication is important!  
7\. Try your best to leave the place as clean as possible. Your host will really appreciate it.   
8\. Don't try to bargain for a cheaper price and even try to negotiate offline. if you are staying for > 1 month, then yes by all means ask for a discount. If you are staying for 1 week and wants a great deal at a superhost's place, errrr you will leave the host thinking that you are a super cheapo and they may just reject your request. The whole reason why transactions should be done via Airbnb is so that you and the host are both protected financially. You can't have your cake and eat it too.

The cottage is located in the residential area in Sonoma. You definitely need a car. We rented a car for the trip. Most residential areas in Sonoma do not have many street lights at night so we tried to get back to the Airbnb before sunset to avoid driving in complete darkness. A did not want me to drive into a vineyard accidentally.

The cottage had a porch in the front with a hammock. There is no light pollution. On a clear day, you can probably sit there and stargaze. We unfortunately were still adjusting to our jetlag so we slept from like 9-3AM, woke up, and watched "Schitt's Creek" till 5AM. I recommend buying a few bottles of wine and just chilling on the porch.

I really love Victoria's mid-century classic furnitures. Tastefully decorated flats take forever to build because you have to collect the pieces of the furniture one by one and think about how it fits into the rest of the dec√≥r. She puts in a lot of thoughts for her Airbnb. She even put in snacks for us in case we were hungry (that is why she is a superhost).   
  
We had a blast in Napa. if solitude is your cup of tea, do check out Victoria's Airbnb (and no, she did not pay me to write this post).
