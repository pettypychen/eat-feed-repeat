Totally love hipster boutique hotels. They are usually small, so they limit the number of people going through the property.

[â€‹Viroth Villa](http://www.viroth-villa.com/) is relatively new. I think it was built in the last 5 years or so. The management has maintained the property well and even opened up Viroth's Hotel which is a slightly bigger boutique down the street.

Queen size bed with open shower concept. The concrete sink is def modern. The villa has a contemporary feel mixed with Khmer decorations like lanterns and traditional Cambodian clay works. The bed is sturdy and comfortable.

We stayed on level 1, so there is a side yard with some chairs for you to sit there and enjoy some take out food/snacks.

The best part about the villa was the breakfast. It is included with the booking of the room. On the day when we had to wake up at 4+AM to see the Angkor Wat sunrise, the villa packed away some bread, hot coffee, and fresh fruits for us in little baskets for our driver to put in his trunk.

(Below) Rooftop patio with chairs for you to eat breakfast. There is a paper and pencil menu for you to tick off things that you want to eat for breakfast.

Obviously, I picked a mango smoothie. The fresh fruits platter was also great. Mango was in season so it was extra delicious.

I was craving hot noodles. What do you know, they have it for breakfast as well.

Horror stories on online travel forums said DO NOT drink water in Cambodia. Well, my solution to that was to drink mango smoothies daily. Make sure you request no ice, although it did not really cause any GI issues for me when I drank them with ice. I guess I lived to tell the tale.
