My father always told me that he was wrapped in flour sacks that were thrown away by the U.S. military as a kid while running around the muddy rice fields, which have since been replaced by Taipei 101. I was, however, raised with disposable diapers because wealth was more abundant during the late 1980s. It is unfathomable to think that after three generations that I would convert back to cloth diapering. My father was skeptical that me, a mega germaphobe, will be willing to touch poo and pee. I was not certain that I would not be put off by the stinky poo, but I told him that I was determined to go green.

## What about the cost of water and electricity for washing these diapers?

**Washer cost (7 loads a week):**  
**Cost Per Month:** SGD $14  
**Cost Per Year:** SGD $170  

## How many cloth diapers do you need?

I googled a bunch to see how many cloth diapers that I needed. Most people think that 16–24 diapers are good enough for a two-day laundry cycle. I am probably going to just wash the cloth diapers every day to keep them stink-free.

##### Cloth diaper cost + Washer Cost for 2 Years: SGD $675 + SGD $340 = SGD $1015

I plan to dry the diapers in the sun most days with occasional dryer usage during the monsoon season.

You aren’t saving that much just for a single child, but we do foresee having a second kid in the near future so cloth diaper will become cheaper for the second kid since we are only paying for the washing at that point.

Another thing that I was considering is not buying any shorts for baby L given the messy situations of potential diaper blowouts. There is no shame for a baby to run around in a onesie with a cloth diaper.
