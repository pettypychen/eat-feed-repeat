It is a norm for new parentals to be sleep deficient and to look for ways to optimise such state. 

## What is sleep training?

Sleep training is to try to get your little one to sleep through the night for approximately 7-8 hours without interruption. 

## Who trains who?

Instead of training my baby to sleep more, I was trained by baby L to sleep on a Q2-3hourly cycle when she was born. After ~2-3 week of waking up every 3 hours to feed baby L, I converted to [polyphasic sleep](https://time.com/5063665/what-is-polyphasic-sleep/)(apparently Leonardo Da Vinci was the pioneer of such sleep method), which had no medical literature to support its benefits. It was definitely unnatural for me since I enjoyed a long block of 8 hours of sleep at my baseline. I was a walking "mombie" (mom zombie). I wracked my brain and tried my best to convert my polyphasic sleep to monophasic again and this is my success story. 

## When can you start training?

For parents, you can start training yourself to go for polyphasic sleep the moment your child is born (lol). 

But I am sure you are here to find out how to train your child like training a dragon. 

Medical professionals don't recommend sleep training for newborns because their stomach is too small. They get hungry pretty quickly (i.e. every 2-3 hours). Just imagine that you can only stuff 30 ml of milk in your belly at a time. Wouldn't you be hungry as well? This is why sleep training from birth to 3 months is not recommended. Babies need milk to grow. If they don't wake up, you gotta wake them up to drink milk to gain the weight that the babies usually lose by week 1-2 post-birth. 

[Parents.com](https://www.parents.com/baby/sleep/basics/sleep-training/) has a pretty good age-by-age breakdown of what you shall expect of your child when it comes to sleep training. **3.5 month** is generally a good milestone to start sleep training. 

## Prep for sleep training

[American Academy of Pediatrics](https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/Pages/American-Academy-of-Pediatrics-Announces-New-Safe-Sleep-Recommendations-to-Protect-Against-SIDS.aspx) recommends parents to sleep in the same room as the baby until the baby turns 1. The rationale is to reduce the risk of [Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_infant_death_syndrome), which is a baby dying without any obvious reason. The exact cause of SIDS is unknown. 

Our ideal state was for baby L to sleep by herself in a separate room, but to monitor her with a baby camera to be safe. I am a light sleeper and was going back to work after 2 months of maternity leave, so I didn't have much choice but to let baby L sleep in her room despite AAP's recommendation. Otherwise, I was not going to get any sleep. I wore earplugs to sleep when baby L's crib was next to me because she would make these awful "cat coughing up a fur ball" noises in her sleep and I would get up every 20 min to check on her. It just was not going to work when I return to work. 

A and I started to train baby L around week # 6 to sleep by herself, but we kept the 9PM, 12PM, 4AM feeds because she was drinking about 80-100ml during each feed and couldn't last longer than 3-4 hours at a time. 

I told baby L 3 days before her move that she was going to sleep in her own room and she would have her own space [Stanford study](https://ed.stanford.edu/news/anne-fernald-how-children-learn-language) that backs-up the idea of talking to babies like an adult and waited for a week when my husband was on vacation to start the trial. We were both mentally prepared to wake up multiple times in a night to soothe her. Baby L took it like a champ and slept the first night on her own without any intervention. She woke up happy and well-rested because I was not leaning over her crib every 20 min to disturb her sleep. I slept better too with her in her own room. 

It is important to see how long the baby can last with the amount of milk that he or she is consuming before you start sleep training. Baby L would drink 90ml and she would be ok for 2.5-3 hours without crying out because she is hangry. She was not ready for sleep training at that point. 

## The real deal

The real sleep training only happened when I noticed that baby L did not need much help to fall asleep during nap time. She would yawn and 5 secs later fall asleep on her own for her morning nap. The milk intake increased to 110ml. She never cried for her milk in between the 3-hour window of feeds. We consistently had to wake her up at midnight for her milk. Week #10 was when the stars aligned and we decided to give it a shot to see how long she could last if we put her to sleep at 10PM. She slept until 5AM the next morning! No diaper leak. No cry. No nothing. 

**I sang Hallelujah that morning!**

We have been doing pretty well with a 9:30 or 10 PM feed before she goes to sleep for the long stretch. It is however common for a baby to regress and *occasionally during growth spurts... babies will wake up despite sleeping beautifully a few weeks before.*

## What about CIO, no tears, Weissbluth, Ferber, chair, and pick-up-put-down method?

None of these [methods](https://www.thebump.com/a/how-to-sleep-train) is scientifically proven to work. Most have anecdotal evidence so the quality supporting such methods is poor. It is like case series equivalent in the clinical research world.  You can try any that suits your parental style. Most peeps will take about one week to train their bebes, so don't get disheartened and try all the methods in one week. Persistence is key. It takes time for a baby to learn to sleep by himself or herself.
