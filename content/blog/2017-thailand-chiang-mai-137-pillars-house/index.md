137 Pillars House is a boutique hotel that I have wanted to go for more than a year. The hotel room price is steep but we managed to get >50% off for traveling during the Chinese Ghost Month. I don't recommend traveling during the Chinese Ghost Month if you are superstitious because the hotels are considered to house "yin" in Chinese beliefs. My grandmother always said don't go looking for troubles during the Chinese Ghost Month. It was safe to say that I did not encounter anything unusual during my stay. â€‹  
  
So why is the hotel named 137 pillars? Because the main dining hall building is made up of 137 wooden pillars. The property used to be owned by Louis Leonowens, son of Anna (yes, as in "Anna and the King"). The decor is more British colonial compared to some of the other hotels that we have stayed in Thailand. Location wise, it is at the fringe of the Old Chiang Mai city. We managed to walk to the night market from the hotel. The area surrounding the hotel is residential, with some gorgeously huge houses (we were peeking over the fence). Nighttime strolls are pretty safe. The local taxis and tuk tuk drivers are not really in your face all the time like Bangkok. You get a sense that people are generally very chill here.

We had our dinner in the The Dining Room. I felt that the food geared towards Western guests with dishes like Pad Thai. The ingredients were very fresh but the portion was on the bigger side. The drinks were on par with Singapore's price but \~3 times in size. A got a flaming coconut alcoholic beverage. Like all awesome and considerate Thai hotels, 137 Pillars House offers their own mosquito spray so you can eat your meal in peace.


A asked me how I felt about the buffet breakfast. I think it was decent plus. I tend to gear towards food that is lighter in taste, but if you like heavier food you may enjoy their selections. We had our breakfast at the hotel every morning.

Would I come back? I think probably no. I still love beaches too much. Plus, the town is really too chill for me. #igotnochill
