ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ **LA, California, USA**

**Address:** 3515 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90010  
**Telephone:** 213 381 7411

When I first saw the [Line Hotel](http://www.thelinehotel.com/) in the mist of my hotel hunt, I was thinking about Brown and Cony from the popular Line application. Out of curiosity, I decided to check out their website. It turned out to be a chic boutique hotel. I read a few online reviews regarding their location/services/nearby restaurants.

**History lesson as told by A's cousin:** The mid-Wilshire area was glamorous back in the 1930s. The nearby Ambassador Hotel used to host the Academy Awards. Around the mid 1970s, the neighborhood began to decline. Over the years, many Koreans have immigrated and established business in the area/revitalized the mid-Wilshire. Today, this is the go to place to get korean BBQ/nightlife.

According to their webpage the interior design of the hotel is by Sean Knibb and food/beverage is by LA's own Roy Choi. If you don't know who Roy Choi is, I suggest you google him. He is the dude who started Korean taco truck and one of the many founders of the food truck movement. Anyway, to cut to the chase, Roy Choi is the brainchild behind the Pot and Commissary.

**Reasons why we chose to stay here:**  
1\. Central LA/convenient  
2\. Within reachable distance to a Whole foods  
3\. To try out Roy Choi's food

When I lived in the States, I hated the junk food there. The only junk food that I will ever admit that I love/crave is In-N-Out...ergo I insisted that we needed to live close to a Whole foods (if all else fail, I can go grab a pack of sushi as my dinner).

The curtains have 2 settings. The blackout setting is amazing for a good night's rest.

The room is itty bitty but can't complain as we are in L.A. The walls are concrete and bare- post industrialesque style (not everyone's cup of tea). I did like the decor a lot. I like the no frills/ clean lines. The bed is really really soft, sort of like you fell into sea of marshmallow kind of softness.

I guess I should have taken a picture of the mini-bar. Everything costs money so I suggest you don't touch the mini-bar. Essentially, I just went to Whole foods and bought a bunch of fresh fruits and ate those as my snacks instead.

**Best benefit:** We were surrounded by many 24-hour Korean tofu houses. Due to jetlag, I was craving bulgogi in the middle of the night. A and I just walked down one block and got spicy pork bulgogi to-go (chuckles).

Sorry to say this but Commissary was a let-down. I did not like the seafood chowder... it had freaking tabasco sauce in it. Don't mess with the classics man. Sad to say, I was muy triste about my lunch there.

We did not go to the Pot, A's cousin told us it was overrated. Try it out yourself and let me know if you love it or hate it.

BTW, do not stay at this awesome boutique hotel if you are light sleeper. People start to party downstairs from Thursday night onwards.
