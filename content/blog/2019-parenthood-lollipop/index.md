No, not those ones you get from a candy shop.

Lollipop is a fantastic baby cam. I did a lot of research before I decided to purchase it. 

### It detects crying sound! Horray!

Let's talk about the first time I saw a baby monitor. It was the year of 1992, shortly after my brother was born. Walkie-talkie was the all the rage in the early 1990s. My aunt bought a Philips baby monitor for my cousin from Costco. I remembered that the whole family waited excitedly in the other room to hear my baby cousin's crying sound.  This was back before you can see people unwrap a shiny new iPhone or hear YouTubers review a new product. "It worked!" someone exclaimed! Yep, that was the old school way of testing a product. If you did not like it, you told your family and friends and return that damn thing. BTW the baby monitor's range was limited and if you were to bring the baby monitor to the garage... you ain't hearing baby crying no more. 

Fast forward to present day... 

Baby tech was neglected while phones shrunk from a shoebox to the size of our palms. The baby monitor that my aunt used still exists today but obviously the range is a lot better. That was not what I wanted in my baby monitor. 

It was not until the last 5 years that people started to apply home security camera features on baby cam. 

## Quick Glance

Lollipop looks like a lollipop and is constructed of premium, baby-safe silicone. It has infrared LED for night vision, 4x digital zoom, and wait for it... made-in-Japan lens. I mean you can't get much better than this in terms of hardware [specs](https://www.lollipop.camera/specs)on the market. 

It is priced at ~$200 SGD, which is pretty reasonable given the features. 

## Features
* Plays white noise (vacuum and even hair drying sound) and classical music 
* Detects crying- you can set your own decibel for detection
* Detects crossing/motion- you can detect your child's attempt to escape the crib
* Notifies you via your phone
* Shows live view of your child if you just want a peek without opening the door

## Looks & Feel

I hate camera that looks like a camera. Lollipop seamlessly fits into the background without standing out. It is not clunky. You can bend the stem to secure it anywhere. My lollipop is currently resting on the Snoo overlooking my baby at night. The colour comes in cotton candy pink, blue, and pistachio. I would prefer a white colour lollipop to fit into the minimalistic nursery for baby L, but blue is still pretty cute. 

## How Do I Use It?

Baby L moves a lot in her sleep but that doesn't mean that she is awake. To avoid having too many notifications at night, I only turn on the crying detection for night time monitoring. Lollipop tells me when baby L is crying vs. crying loud or if the Snoo has started levelling up to calm her (aka environment is noisy). The Snoo will turn up the volume of the white noise when the baby is fussy. If I receive a notification, I would usually look at the live feed to see what is up. If I see that baby L is still sleeping then I won't open the door to check how she is doing. 

## Cybersecurity

After working for an IoT blockchain company last year when we were in California, I constantly worry about people hacking into our network via IoT devices and watch our every move. See the [news article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/12/20/nest-cam-baby-monitor-hacked-kidnap-threat-came-device-parents-say/). A and I make sure that we use password protection for wifi. All IoT devices will have username and password change once it is in our home rather than keeping the default. Here are some tips on how to ensure that your baby cam is [secured](https://www.which.co.uk/reviews/baby-monitors/article/could-my-baby-monitor-get-hacked). We don't name the camera based on the location i.e. bedroom or living room. 

Also, limit the area which the camera points at. Our camera points at the baby when baby L sleeps and that is it. Check the angle of the camera to make sure that it won't capture videos clips of the baby being changed or breastfeeding. I always put a muslin wrap over the camera if I need to breastfeed in the same room. My paranoia is also the reason why I don't get a camera that can be controlled remotely and moves. 

Lollipop uploads the video clips to AWS. The [video clips are encrypted](https://www.lollipop.camera/help/article/13) during the transfer.  There is a privacy mode that you can turn on if you don't want any clip of your child to exist on any cloud. 

They recommend that for added security, always make sure your Lollipopâ€™s firmware is up-to-date and your wifi password is long and hard to guess. Lollipop's [privacy policy](https://www.lollipop.camera/privacy/).
