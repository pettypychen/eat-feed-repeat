Well, the flower is not something you need as a new mom. Flowers probably will die because you forgot about changing the water in the vase and add in flower food. 

OMG, everyone tells you what you need for your baby. No one tells you what you need as a mom so I am gonna tell you what you really need. 

If you want to be a great friend, buy things for the mother and not the baby. The baby won't know the wiser because it has no memory yet.... but the mother will forever love you as a friend. üòç

> On a side note, my mother said all I needed was her. I was like üëç. But I clearly needed more than just my own mother. 


1. **Postnatal massage and binding:** Your body goes through a lot of stress during delivery. You will be sore all over and have bruises in places that you did not expect. Treat yourself to postnatal massage because you have suffered enough. For binding, I bought a simple post-delivery binding to just pack the extra belly fat immediately after the delivery. I thought about getting one of those beautiful [Veronique](https://www.designveronique.com/maternity) compression stockings that we made our patients to wear post reconstructive surgery but it had to be measured/ had a long lead time for it so I ended up just getting custom binding (Bengkung) from the postnatal massage and binding package. The truth was I would unwrap myself before 6PM every day. I never made it pass dinner time and I felt terrible telling my masseuse that I had 0 will/stamina to last till 8PM and wear the bengkung at least 12 hours a day. It was just way too painful and too tight for me. The binding did help with the swelling that I had and sped up uterine contraction. The best part of the massage was the breast massage for engorgement. I cannot tell you how painful it was when the milk was coming in. I literally cried every time my masseuse checked for blocked ducts. They were blocked all the time. ü§¨ Those first two weeks of pregnancy felt like my body was broken for the first time in forever. It felt painful peeing and pooing and you literally would be like, "I have suffered enough".

2. **Extra-large diaper like pad:** No one tells you that you will bleed like no other post delivery. You think your menses taking a break for 9 months was the best thing ever? Think again. I bled for over 1 month and no one... I repeat no one... not even my mother prepared me for that. You need to buy those medical grade pads and dignity pads if you want to sleep without waking up to a small tiny pool of blood like Carrie.   

3. **Nipple cream:** It really does not matter what type of nipple cream you get. SGH will give you the Medela nipple cream and that is good enough. I bought a pretty big jar of organic nipple cream and did not use most of it because everyone gives you nipple cream. I don't know why people want to protect your nipples but they do. But for reals though, you need it. You don't want strawberry breastmilk. You don't want your bra rubbing against the raw skin after your kid decided that your nipple is a chew toy.   

4. **Witch Hazel:** [Mayo clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/labor-and-delivery/in-depth/postpartum-care/art-20047233#:~:text=To%20ease%20discomfort%20while%20you,as%20you're%20passing%20urine.) recommends hazel pads to ease the discomfort you would experience from the vaginal tear. Singapore is hot, so you don't need hot water but you should clean your private parts with a bidet spray to keep things squeaky clean. I got a spray bottle full of witch hazel chilling at the sink. It was the best set-up. You don't want to bend down and pick up something that you always need when you do your business! Not with the bengkung binding! You can't f$@#$! bend in that thing.  

5. **Nipple pads:** For those leaky breasts. I had the irrational fear that I would leak while wearing a white shirt all the time. I did not actually have any problem with this because I constantly struggled with underproducing breastmilk. I cried about it too. But I loved [bamboobies](https://bamboobies.com/collections/bamboobies-nursing-pads). They were really soft. The heartshape ones are cute. ‚ô•Ô∏è  

6. **[Medela freestyle breast pump](https://www.medela.com/breastfeeding/products/breast-pumps/freestyle):** I wanted something super portable for work so I went with freestyle. Do NOT microwave the tubes. I broke my tubes from microwaving it. It melted after 3 min in the microwave! Then I could not pump for 3 days and I was extra stressed about it. Pumps are always on sale. Got my pump from a Mothercare sale. Don't ever buy your pump at the full ticket price. Some people's insurance might cover it so check it before you buy it. The best part of Medela is that I could inhale my lunch while getting the pump to do its job at the same time so it defintely deserves an award for efficiency. Pair it with pump bra to be 100% hands-free. I would not do housework in this though. Gentle but furious email typing is ok while you pump. I like to clip the pump to my shorts because it is as fashionable as middle-aged Chinese uncles wearing phones on their belt.   

7. **[Elvie breast pump](https://www.elvie.com/en-us/shop/elvie-pump):** These were so beautiful and I wanted to love them so much. My only concern was the speed and the amount you would get from them. I was an underproducer so you always want to pump a bit more than what is coming out to make sure the breasts get the hint to produce more milk for the b√©b√©. I just did not have enough time in the pump room to wait for these babies to do their thing. I prefer Medela's aggressive pumping... it was kind of painful but short and gets the job done.

8. **A super big cooler:** I don't know why people want a tiny cooler just to hold your precious breast milk. I got one of those grocery style cooler and just dump the mini cooler in along with everything else I needed to pump. It was way easier than having like 15 bags all carrying different things. When you have a mom's brain, you need to Marie Kondo  everything you have. 
9. **500ml to 1L water bottle:** Producing milk is liquid intensive, so you do actually need a water bottle even if you are filled with 98% caffeine before you were pregnant. I remember I was thirsty all the time. 
10. **Wipes:** Buy large packs of [wipes](https://www.pupsikstudio.com/lec-99-9-pure-water-hand-mouth-wet-wipes-3x80-240pc-1.html) when they are on sale! Every parent would love you if you get these things for them because they always need wipes. I was a cheapo and bought the thin wipes then I regretted it when I got poo on my hands. 


What a new mom would appreciate is to not smell the coffee because she can't drink it! ‚òïÔ∏è

Go forth, be a supportive friend or well prepared mother. üòâ
