Babies poo and that is the universal truth. But it is another level to catch poo and pee in mid-progression while minimising a mess in the surrounding.

Baby L hates to poo in a dirty diaper. My hypothesis is that she doesnâ€™t like the poo sticking onto her butt and sit in a soiled diaper for 3 hours before I change her.

Unlike some parents, we (or me unilaterally) decided that we were only going to change baby Lâ€™s diaper before we feed her. The internetâ€™s wisdom is that you shall change it when the diaper line turns magically blue = soiled diaper. The rationale behind changing her before we feed her is that she will have a sense of toileting routine plus the cloth diaper doesnâ€™t come with a magical yellow line that will turn blue. Also, I am lazy and didnâ€™t want to wash extra cloth diapers if I didnâ€™t have to. Rest assure my babyâ€™s bottom is healthy and rash-free. The extreme end of diaper change frequency is to wait for your child to cry. But some kids just donâ€™t care about sitting in their own pee or poo so if you have one of those kids then good luck. 

We also had another debate about whether to change her diaper before or after and ended up trialling both but that is another story.

I digress. This story is about catching poo. Since her birth, baby L hates dirty diaper. She would scream bloody murder every time there was a single drop of poo on her disposable diaper. We were going through at least 12 diapers a day because she had little bowel control so every fart became a shart.

When she had neonatal jaundice, we had to send her to the pediatric hospital and that is when she received her first set of bowel training. The nurses were busy and they had 10 babies in one ward so logically speaking didnâ€™t have time to change baby Lâ€™s diaper 12 times. My mother was appalled when she saw baby Lâ€™s red flaming bottom when she came home. I was on the other hand secretly glad that she has been trained to sit quietly in her dirty diaper and wait until someone changes her.


But that is when the trouble began...she thought that **no one** was going to change her so she would wait until that I change her to poo and pee at the same time

**Option A:** on my hand  
**Option B:** on the changing mat/ my bed  
**Option C:** on the new diaper

That is when I became the catcher of poo and pee.

## Catching Pee

It is best to not catch any pee. This is not a baseball. You will fail and get something wet in the process. I have tried this many times. To minimise the mess in the surrounding, just lean into it. I let my shirt soak up as much of her pee as possible. It is ultimately easier to change my shirt vs. the whole bedsheet.  Plus, you can never take too many showers a day. 

### Preventive Measures

Use a wet wipe and gently swipe across the baby's belly before you open the diaper. It works wonders. Train your baby to associate that cold sensation with peeing in the diaper. 


## Catching Poo

Ah...for a while I thought I was toilet training baby L. Turns out she was training me. Like an old person (no offence to an old person), baby L likes to poo early in the morning at 5 AM. There was a good period of 1 week (age ~2.5 months) when I got fed up with her pooing in the new diapers that I changed so I decided that I was going to sit there and wait for her to poo. It is like fishing and waiting for things to happen...

I cut up a bunch of disposable bed sheet (aka blue sheet because it is blue) to the size that will fit baby L's bum and I laid it there and waited for her. Catching one poo after another... I would use a tissue to wipe her poo away and fold the tissue under her butt so that baby L thinks that it is a clean diaper again! What a genius idea! 

Once I set up this system, I would watch her from afar and away from the splash zone while I fold her laundry. But alas, your plan never goes very well when it comes to a baby.  Like a true baby, baby L will try to paddle her feet inside of her poo. I had one incidence of her rolling around in her own poo and in the process got poo smeared all over my arms. That was no bueno. I had to wash her in our sink, wash my arm in the sink, and wash the sink to decontaminate the poo.

***Pro parent tip:** use a shower curtain to line any surface that you plan to change your baby on. Easy clean up with a wet wipe! You can even toss the shower curtain into the washing machine to get a quick clean.  
***Side note:** the blue sheet is also known as dignity sheet. 

Besides catching poo, I have held her over the toilet bowl for 10 minutes, hoping that she would poo directly into it. BUT she didn't. She pooed the moment I put her down on the changing mat. ðŸ˜­

Just when I thought I was good at catching her poo, she started to change her bowel opening schedule. In "me vs. daughter", the daughter has won this round. 

The lesson I learned is that you can't toilet train a baby at 3 months old.
