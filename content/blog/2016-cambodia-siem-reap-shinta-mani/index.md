[Shinta Mani Club/Resort](www.shintamani.com/club) is another great Cambodian boutique hotel which opened in 2013. It is on the pricier side compared to Viroth's Villa, but A and my parents decided that we needed a treat on our last day in Cambodia. The hotel is French quarter style and designed by the acclaimed architect Bill Bensley, who also designed St. Regis Bali. The property has over 39 rooms on the Club side. The Resort side, which is just across the street, has a bigger pool and even more rooms. Although it is an older property, the Resort is equally charming. I love how they incorporate Angkor artwork throughout the hotel. The rooms are beautifully designed.

Immediately after we came back from our temple hopping, we were offered cool towels at the drop off point to clean off our sweat and the concierge service took our luggages upstairs. They can even call you a tuk tuk or recommend dinner plans.

The bed is queen size and on the firm side. Welcome champagne and fresh fruits. â€‹The flowers are all freshly folded and placed on the tables daily. How do I know? Because we saw some employees sitting in the corner folding flowers during our morning strolls. The attention to detail is impeccable.

During our stay, Shinta Mani Club was hosting some business pow-wow so we were ask to enjoy our breakfast at the Shinta Mani Resort. The above is the menu they offered.

The breakfast offered are mainly Western style, which were mediocre. A makes better pancakes for sure. I think you can probably get better Khmer food elsewhere. We ate the breakfast nevertheless since it was already included in our stay.

**Side story:** A got food poisoning on the last day. He said it was good that we were staying at a nice boutique hotel since he was in bed the whole day/using the toilet nonstop.
