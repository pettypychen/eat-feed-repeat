Located on a street full of luxury brands store, Panini Tartufati Procacci is a hidden gem. We literally walked around three times before we finally found the store. It was our first stop in Florence. They are known for their truffle sandwiches and wine. We budgeted about â‚¬5 for our snack. The moment we walked in, I was totally amazed by the smell of truffle. The sandwiches cost â‚¬1.30 to 2. There were multiple flavors to choose from. We didn't speak Italian so we sort of guessed what the flavors are by looking at the color inside of the sandwiches. There are small tables on the side where you can eat and people watch.   
  
As we munched away our delicious snacks, an Italian lady walked in and order a glass of wine at the counter. I guess a little glass of wine can't hurt during work hours.

OMG, so delicious. Mind you, these are tiny cold sandwiches. Definitely not for a full meal. The truffles were so good that I almost had an impulse buy of their truffle butter.
