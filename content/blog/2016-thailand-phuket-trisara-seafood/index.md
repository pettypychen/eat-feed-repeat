After a long hiatus, I decided to continue my blog again (food photo are building up in my album). This is a recap of my trip to Phuket.  
  
A and I stayed at Trisara in Phuket, Thailand last June. Unfortunately, it rained everyday when we were in town. The first day was a stormy night so we had the restaurant all to ourselves (ok, there was another middle-age couple in a few tables down from where we were seated). The service at this restaurant is excellent. The sommelier offered up white wines to pair with our seafood, but A and I declined since we had plenty of alcohol from our post wedding party. The waiters would come and refill our waters/gave me extra truffle butter (the _real_ truffle butter). OMG, the truffle butter was amazing with their lightly toasted bread basket. There were other options such as seaweed flavours if truffle is not your cup of tea.   
  
The only thing that I had concerns about was the lighting. It was very dim/candle lights (obviously very romantic) so my food photo came out slightly blurry and I was too lazy to adjust the settings.

## Sashimi salmon / fish roe / avocado reduction

We also had their fresh tuna tartar with pomelo, citrus, ginger and dried seaweed. I did not take a picture of it because I was too hungry to document.

Risotto Canadian lobster / white truffle / sea urchin / romanescoThis was an absolutely lovely mains. Perfect al dente. Obviously I ordered it for the white truffle. The lobster was very fresh and cooked just right- not too chewy. Highly recommend this dish.

Tiger prawn on pink Himalayan salt rockFresh prawn, but be careful of the salt slab it was super hot. The salt slab seasoned the tiger prawn really well. The only sad thing was that there were only 3 shrimps for the 2 of us to share.

Overall dinning experience was excellent. Like they say, you get what you pay for. Although if you are not living in the area, Trisara is a bit difficult to get to. It is hidden in the northern part of the Phuket \~45 minutes from Phuket town.
