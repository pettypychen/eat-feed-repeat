Hansar Bangkok is 28 km away from Suvarnabhumi International Airport (BKK) and 23 km away from Don Mueang International Airport (DMK). It took us about 30 minutes to get from Don Mueang to the hotel, but our cab driver was definitely speeding.   
  
Transportation from airport to the city is pretty easy peasy. The airport cab services will definitely rip you off. We were lucky enough that there were some cabs that just dropped off their passenger at the departure terminal and came by the arrival area to see if they could pick up a customer on the way back to the city.

**Grab taxi** or **uber** also works here. With good planning, you should be able to use free airport wifi to get yourself a ride and just wait at the terminal. It was late (2:30AM) when we arrived, so I was like nah I don't feel like waiting for the uber driver after standing in line for close to 2 hours at the immigration line (CNY craze). It was really "no bueno."

A's sister recommended this hotel as it is hip and eco-friendly. We absolutely agreed! We opted for the urban suite which came with a living area, a nice soft bed, a walk-in closet, and an open concept bath. Don't expect a view in Bangkok. After all, Bangkok is a city. The public transport train system is super close to the hotel. It definitely makes it extra convenient to get to places in Bangkok.  
  
Our suite was warmly lit. You can choose your pillow from their pillow menu. I am not a picky pillow person so I did not try out their selection of pillows.

Our stay came with a free 30 minute massage at their signature spa: Luxsa. A and I both chose the neck and shoulder massage. It was heavenly. They gave us pre-massage purple tea and post-massage yellow tea. I really had no idea what was in the tea but both tasted fresh. The full 1 hour massage is on the pricy side. I know most people come to Thailand for cheap massage, but a place like Luxsa does offer more privacy and relaxation.

The lobby and waiting area is just gorgeous. If we had the time, I would have just brought a book here to read.

Daily breakfast at the Eve resturant was one of my favourite parts of my stay. Every morning, they put out the best fruits that Thailand has to offer. There is also a bucket of freshly squeezed juice for you to choose what sort of detox you want for the day.  | Pad Thai and fresh mango juice = the best way to start my vacation. The pad thai is very meh though but their Western breakfast selection is pretty good. Try some mini baguette with mango or coconut jam. You have to try the jam, it was delicious! |

The alternative caffeine source would be Elefin coffee, which sells exclusive Thai specialty coffee along with pastries made from organic, local, and farm-to-table ingredients. Elefin has another B&B in Old Bangkok for mainly small groups of travelers. Would love to check them out next time I am in Bangkok. BTW, their coffee is strong. It will wake you up!

Pool bar, come here if you feel like chilling. There is also a gym! Hansar is also a service apartment. If you are in town for business assignment, this would also be a great place to stay.   
  
Overall, I loved my stay at Hansar but Bangkok has so much to offer in terms of boutique hotels. If it is not within your price range, check out other options like Airbnb.
