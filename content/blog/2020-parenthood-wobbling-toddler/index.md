I had an argument with my father on the approach of teaching baby L walking. He believes every child should use a walker. I used a baby walker and I learned to walk before I turned 1. Baby L took her first step the week before she turned 1 but she was not walking yet. The grandparents were measuring my child with a yard stick and that yard stick was me. 

American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) do not recommend walkers. Here's another doctor from [Harvard Health Publishing](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/parents-dont-use-a-baby-walker-2018092714895) telling you the same thing. 

Contrary to popular belief...

## Walker is dangerous! ü§Ø

Canada actually [banned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_walker#:~:text=In%20Canada%2C%20the%20sale%20of,yard%20sales%20or%20flea%20markets.) baby walkers in 2004. 

You should never let a baby use walker without supervision. Babies can
* Trip over something and fall
* Roll down stairs
* Get caught in bewteen places and not able to get out

## Walkers actually don't help babies to walk

There is research to suggest that baby walkers eliminate the desire to walk. Babies feel like they are mobile enough with the walker and therefore they don't want to practice the very complex and coordinated effort of standing and lifting one leg forward follow by the next. 

## BUT... baby walkers are super cute

I got the Katoji baby walker from a Japanese expat mom for $20. I just loved how chic it looks. Also, the fact that it is foldable and take up 0 space in a baby product filled home. #mariekondo

In the end, the super cute walker ended up more like a restraint for contained movement within the bedroom while I fold laundry. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It was more of a toy than an actual walker. 

You can't rush how fast or slow a baby would learn to walk. It took baby L at least 1 month to get good at walking and that was with me practising with her every day patiently.
